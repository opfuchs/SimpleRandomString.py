# SimpleRandomString.py

## v0.02

Exactly what it says on the tin. This is a simple python script (barely even a script) that generates and prints a random ASCII string of the desired length using CSPRNGs as part of a student project many years ago. This length is currently specified by simply setting the value `n` in the actual code.

__WARNING__: **DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**. "Don't roll your own crypto" as they say. There are plenty of libraries designed and vetted by actual crypto experts for use in important, complicated things. This is simply a little tool that was a student project from years ago.

## Description and Usage

`SimpleRandomString.py` simply prints a random ASCII string of length `n`, where `n` is specified by the user by editing the code and replacing `n` in the `print` function (it's really just a big one-liner broken up for readability). This can obviously be quickly modified into a function that returns but does not print such a string, and I intend to include this feature in the future. The user may also choose, depending on their purpose, what *sorts* of ASCII characters they want to allow in generated strings by adding or removing `string.foo` terms from inside `.choice()`.


The core point of the tool is that it uses cryptographically secure system CSPRNGs. The regular `random` and things like `np.random` are not designed for cryptographically secure applications (in the case of the latter for example, the purpose is scientific/mathematical computing). `SimpleRandomString.py` uses the system CSPRNG via `random.SystemRandom()`, specifically:

* `CryptGenRandom()` on Windows, which you can read more about [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379942(v=vs.85).aspx) and here.[1][2]
* `/dev/urandom/` on *nix-like systems. This is not intended to be an applied cryptography lesson, but if you want to know why `/dev/urandom/` is a better source of randomness in cryptographic scenarios than `/dev/random` on *nix, see [here](https://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/). tl;dr, neither is "true randomness" (we are dealing with CS *P* RNGS) after all, the difference lies in blocking behavior.

## TODO

1. Incorporate some functionality from `secrets`
2. Make this a proper command line application, e.g. `SimpleRandomString.py -a -v 32` rather than just a one-liner the user has to edit.
